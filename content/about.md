## Introduction

Hi I'm Pavana Narayana K AKA `Pa1NarK`, an 8-bit developer, interested in information security. I spend most of time lurking around data breaches, latest CVEs and stalking repos on GitHub. However, that's not the end. I do have experience automating stuffs here and there and love contributing to **open-source** (which is where I live) for a better world.

A lot of my work is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com).

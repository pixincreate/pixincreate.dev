## Introduction

Hi I'm Pavana Narayana K AKA `Pa1NarK`, an 8-bit developer, interested in information security. I spend most of time lurking around data breaches, latest CVEs and stalking repos on GitHub. However, that's not the end. I do have experience automating stuffs here and there and love contributing to **open-source** (which is where I live) for a better world.

A lot of my work is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com).

## Interests

- A bit of AI
- Andorid and app development
- Graphics and Animation, CUDA
  - This also includes photo and video editing as well
- Privacy, security and human rights
- RISC-V
- Rust and Python based projects
- WEb development

## Experience

- Worked as a backend developer intern for _Aquem Private Ltd._ and developed a frame work that enabled the team to easily integrate `DJango` with `MongoDB` (`MongoDB Atlas`, to be specific) through `PyMongo` that helps ease work with `React`
- Worked for _Camp Yellow Global_ (which is shut down in the month of November 2022) as a Software Engineer Intern and helped them communicate with 1000+ schools across the globe for in-person as well as virtual events and competitions
- Worked as full-stack developer intern for _ICSolutions_ and designed a website that is similar to `wowitshappening(dot)com` which never made it to being hosted unfortunately
- At _Juspay_(_Hyperswitch_, to be specific), as a **Technical Product Analyst Intern**, integrated a _NMI_ connector with _ApplePay_ and _GooglePay_ support, documented details about various connectors, developed features for _Checkout_ and _ACI_ connectors
Did a lot of _SDE_ work in _RustLang_ and fixed a lot of bugs after joining as a **QE**, wrote an entire test suite to run automated tests to catch bugs within the product like a _DevOps_ Engineer

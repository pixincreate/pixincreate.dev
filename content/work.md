A lot of my i.e., Pa1NarK's work are [open-source](https://github.com/pixincreate?tab=repositories) and some of them are attached below:

- Meet the [_**Automeet**_](https://github.com/pixincreate/Automeet),

- [_**Attachments**_](https://github.com/pixincreate/Attachments), is an open-source Android app, built as an OSS alternative to CMF watch app with privacy baked-in. Currently in pre-alpha stage
- [_**Leak-Checker**_](https://github.com/pixincreate/leak-checker), a tiny VSCode extension that checks if you've any sensitive content in your codebase that might have a possibility of getting commited or being exposed to the outside world and constantly pops around you until you fix it either by removing it or adding it to `.gitignore`
- [_**mGMSCompat**_](https://github.com/pixincreate/mGMSCompat) is a promising Magisk module that adds support for running GMS (Google Mobile Serrvices) apps just like any normal user apps. This is currently stalled due to low available bandwidth and lack of proper in-depth knowledge since it requires modifying ROM codebase

- [_**PyMoJango Framework**_](https://github.com/pixincreate/pymojango-framework), a tiny little framework for web development that enables easy integration with `DJango` and `MongoDB` through `PyMongo` which eventaully eases the pain of integrating with `React` as a separate thing
- [_**Snake Xenzia**_](https://github.com/pixincreate/snake_game), a 2D game based on `OpenGL` (piston game engine) in `Rust`
